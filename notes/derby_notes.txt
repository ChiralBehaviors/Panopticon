must set property and then REBOOT THE WHOLE SERVER, not just reconnect. Boo

starting to think that creating derby db should be done in java rather than liquibase
table stuff can be done in liquibase. Maybe.

CHANGES MADE TO SUPPORT DERBY
	<dbms type="derby">
	
	Only the database owner can create a schema with a name different from the current user name, and only the the database owner can specify
	AUTHORIZATION user-name
	with a user name other than the current user name. See "derby.database.sqlAuthorization" for information about the derby.database.sqlAuthorization property.
	Note: Although the SQL standard allows you to specify any AuthorizationIdentifier as an AUTHORIZATION argument, Derby allows you to specify only a user, not a role. However, when creating a Derby database using the Network Server, the value for the schema becomes the value of the username used to connect with as part of the database URL.
	
	Schema ownership change syntax: CREATE SCHEMA core_admin AUTHORIZATION core
	
	Removed schema comments
	
	Changed schema 'sysadmin' to 'core_sysadmin' because schema names can't start with 'sys'
	
	DerbyFunctions.java - collection of utils in create-db to replace liquibase functions
		in create-db because functions must be compiled before use in liquibase. Could probably do this in create-schema too, but I didn't
		null_zero wants a generic object, and derby doesn't have those. Might have to overload
		
	removed roles entry from ruleform.xml because I'm damn lazy
	
	removed domains entry from ruleform.xml because I'm damn lazy
	
	agency table:
		changed name and description column lengths to 100 and 2000 respectively because no one needs a million characters in those fields
	
		changed timestamp default value to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and type from TIMESTAMPTZ to TIMESTAMP
		updatedby INT8 -> BIGSERIAL
		updatedby onupdate CASCADE -> NO ACTION
		
		removed agency/grants.xml and owner.xml from build order
		
		
	removed all entries from triggerFunctions.xml for now
	
	commented out all entries from triggers.xml for now
	
	commented out all core.xml core-admin and readable entries for now
	
	
CREATE TABLE ruleform.agency (id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, description VARCHAR(2000), notes VARCHAR(2000), updated_by INT8 NOT NULL, update_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT ('now'::text)::timestamp(6) with time zone NOT NULL, pinned SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT agency_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)): Syntax error: Encountered "(" at line 1, column 218.
